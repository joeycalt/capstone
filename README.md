## User Stories

The user will be anyone who would like to track their purchases or anyone who would like to be on a strict budget. The user will be able to input where and what the they purchased, and how much money each purchase was. I will try to implement an idea where the site adds up all the cost of each product so the user will be able to see their total and compare it to the budget they entered.

## Technologies Used

- Django
- Python
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PSQL

## Some things I enjoyed working on

Using Django was a little tough at first, but it started to become more clear to me as the project went on. Really enjoyed working with Django and Python, much more understandable. Also being able to use Bootstrap with ease, it was great being able to style the site.

## Stretch Goals

In the future I would like to implement a counter for the detail page that adds up all the purhcases made and help the user clearly see how much money they have left to spend. Another stretch feature would be to make this app mobile freindly so people could use it on the go.
