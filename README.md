# Capstone
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
- **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have?
- **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
- **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
- **Milestones:** Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.

Scope: For my Capstone project I am planning to build an app where a user can track their budget.

User Stories: The user will be anyone who would like to track their purchases or anyone who would like to be on a strict budget. The user will be able to input where and what the they purchased, and how much money each purchase was. I will try to implemement an idea where the site adds up all the cost of each product so the user will be able to see their total and compare it to the budget they entered.

Data Models: 

Milestones: Most essential- User to be able to input the purchase they made, i.e. what they purchased, from where, and how much. The user will be able to delete or edit the inputs. Lastly, be able to select specific purchases and pin them to the main list. ***(Expect to be done by 10/11/22)***
Important features- User to be able to search for a product in case they need to make an edit or delete. As well as pagination. ***(Expect to be done by 10/13/22)***
Features to be saved- User to be able to insert their weekly budget and each purchase to be added up so the user can easily see how close they are to reaching their budget. ***(Expect to be done by 10/16/22)***

Scope: For my Capstone project I am planning to build an app where a user can track their budget. I will be using Django/Python fullstack to complete this project along with Bootstrap for the styling.

User Stories: The user will be anyone who would like to track their purchases or anyone who would like to be on a strict budget. The user will be able to input where and what the they purchased, and how much money each purchase was. I will try to implement an idea where the site adds up all the cost of each product so the user will be able to see their total and compare it to the budget they entered.
